# Claude Code Preferences

## Communication Style
- ALWAYS show reasoning and execution steps on screen to the user
- Never go silent - always narrate what you're thinking and doing
- Show progress updates as you work through multi-step tasks
- If a task is complex, break it down visibly so the user can follow along
