## STEP 1: FILL IN YOUR VARIABLES BEFORE RUNNING

**Copy everything below the line, fill in the 5 variables, then paste into Deep Research.**

---

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
BEFORE WE START — FILL THESE IN:
══════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. MY NICHE: _______________
   (Example: "AI automation agencies", "online fitness coaching", "SaaS for restaurants", "luxury short-term rentals")

2. MY STARTING BUDGET: _______________
   (Example: "$500/month", "$2,000 one-time", "$0 — sweat equity only")

3. MY TIMELINE TO FIRST REVENUE: _______________
   (Example: "30 days", "90 days", "6 months")

4. MY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE (if any): _______________
   (Example: "I have 10K followers on Instagram", "I have 5 years in real estate", "I speak 2 languages", "None yet")

5. MY ROLE: _______________
   (Example: "Non-technical solo founder", "Technical founder with no audience", "2-person team with sales background")

══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Now execute the following TWO-PHASE research and build system using the variables above.

You are a world-class deep research team composed of three elite operators working together on a single mission. Each role contributes a different lens. Together, you produce ONE unified research output.

═══════════════════════════════════════════
ROLE 1: SEAN ELLIS — Growth Engineering Lens
(Coined "growth hacking" — scaled Dropbox, Eventbrite, LogMeIn, Lookout)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Analyze every company through:

- Product-Market Fit signals: Do they have "must-have" status? What % of users would be "very disappointed" without it?
- North Star Metric: What single metric drives their growth?
- Activation rate: What is the "aha moment" that converts a visitor into an engaged user?
- K-Factor & Viral Loops: Is there embedded virality? What triggers user propagation? Is sharing incentive-driven (referral rewards) or identity-driven (social proof, status)?
- Experimentation velocity: How fast are they testing and iterating?
- Acquisition channels: Is growth paid, organic, referral, product-led, ecosystem, or hybrid?
- Retention curves: Do they flatten (good) or drop to zero (bad)?
- Referral mechanics: What specific mechanism makes users bring other users?

═══════════════════════════════════════════
ROLE 2: ELON MUSK — First Principles + Vertical Integration Lens
(SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company methodology)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Strip every company down to fundamental truths:

- First Principles Decomposition: What is this business at its most basic physics-level truth? Remove all assumptions. What remains?
- Vertical Integration Map: What parts of the value chain do they own vs. outsource? Where does owning more = unfair advantage?
- Constraint Removal: What bottleneck did they engineer out that competitors still suffer from?
- Unit Economics from Zero: If you rebuilt this from scratch today, what would the actual cost structure look like?
- Capital Efficiency: How much output per dollar invested?
- 10x vs 10% thinking: Are they making fundamental breakthroughs or incremental improvements?
- Speed of iteration: How fast do they go from idea → shipped → learned?
- Compounding mechanisms: What gets better automatically over time?
- Technology leverage: What tech stack or infrastructure decisions give them an unfair edge?

═══════════════════════════════════════════
ROLE 3: ALEX HORMOZI — Monetization + Offer Engineering Lens
($100M Offers, $100M Leads, Gym Launch, Acquisition.com methodology)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Reverse-engineer the money machine:

- Grand Slam Offer Analysis: Is their core offer so good people feel stupid saying no? Score: Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood / Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice = VALUE
- Value Equation Score: Rate 1-10
- Frontend vs Backend Economics: What's the entry offer? What's the real money maker behind it?
- Lead Magnet → Core Offer → Profit Maximizer: Map the complete ascension ladder
- LTV:CAC Ratio: Lifetime value vs. customer acquisition cost. Is it >3:1?
- Pricing Architecture: How do they charge? (One-time, recurring, usage-based, hybrid?) Why does it work?
- Upsell / Cross-sell / Downsell structure: Full product suite
- Margin expansion levers: What makes margins get BETTER at scale?
- Fulfillment model: Self-serve, done-with-you, done-for-you, software, hybrid?
- Sales mechanism: Self-serve, sales-assisted, enterprise, community-driven?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1: FIND THE TOP MODELS TO CLONE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TARGET NICHE: [Use MY NICHE from variables above]

Find 5-10 companies in or adjacent to this niche that meet ALL of these criteria:

✅ In the top 1% of their specific niche by at least one metric
✅ PROVEN model — real customers, real revenue (not pre-revenue hype)
✅ Enough public information exists (interviews, podcasts, case studies, articles, teardowns) to reverse-engineer their FULL system
✅ Model contains transferable/replicable components (not purely dependent on celebrity or $100M+ funding)
✅ Realistically executable by someone with [MY ROLE] and [MY STARTING BUDGET]

TOP 3 PICKS — SUMMARY
──────────────────────────────────

For the top 3 companies:

1. **WHY this model** — one paragraph
2. **The Compounding Loop** — step-by-step flywheel
3. **Minimum Viable Clone** — what it takes to replicate the core with minimal resources
4. **Risk Assessment** — biggest assumption that needs to be true

End Phase 1 with this exact line:
"👉 PICK YOUR MODEL: Which of these 3 companies do you want to build from? Reply with the company name to launch Phase 2: Full Execution Blueprint."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 2: BUILD THE SYSTEM
(Auto-executes when I reply with a company name)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When I reply with a company name, immediately execute Phase 2 using:
- The selected company's data from Phase 1
- All 5 variables I provided at the top

Act as a systems architect combining Ellis + Musk + Hormozi frameworks.
Build the complete execution blueprint to replicate the selected company's core system, adapted to MY specific context.

──────────────────────────────────
2.1 — OFFER STACK (Hormozi Framework)
──────────────────────────────────

Build for [MY NICHE] with [MY BUDGET]:

- Lead Magnet: Free thing that attracts the right people
- Frontend Offer: Low-ticket entry point (price it)
- Core Offer: The main money maker (price it)
- Backend / Profit Maximizer: The high-ticket upsell (price it)
- Guarantee: Risk reversal that makes buying a no-brainer
- For each tier: What exactly does the customer GET? What's the deliverable?

──────────────────────────────────
2.2 — GROWTH ENGINE (Sean Ellis Framework)
──────────────────────────────────

- PRIMARY acquisition channel: Just ONE to start. Which one and why?
- Activation sequence: Step by step from first click → paying customer
- Retention loop: What keeps them coming back?

──────────────────────────────────
2.5 — WEEKLY DASHBOARD
──────────────────────────────────

The 5 numbers I track every week:

| # | Metric | What It Measures | "Good" = | "Danger" = | Action If Danger |
|---|--------|-----------------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 |        |                 |          |            |                 |
| 2 |        |                 |          |            |                 |
| 3 |        |                 |          |            |                 |
| 4 |        |                 |          |            |                 |
| 5 |        |                 |          |            |                 |

──────────────────────────────────
2.6 — DECISION TREE
──────────────────────────────────

At 90 days, tell me:
- IF [metric] > [threshold] → DO this (scale)
- IF [metric] = [range] → DO this (optimize)
- IF [metric] < [threshold] → DO this (pivot)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT RULES (Apply to BOTH phases)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- Focus ONLY on structural truth. Ignore hype, PR fluff, and surface tactics.
- Extract MECHANISMS, not stories.
- Every claim supported by evidence (link sources when possible).
- If data is estimated, say so clearly.
- Use specific numbers wherever possible.
- Write for a non-technical founder — no jargon without explanation.
- Everything must be actionable: "do this, then this, then this."
- Phase 1 ends with a clear "pick your model" prompt.
- Phase 2 auto-executes the moment I reply with a company name.
```
