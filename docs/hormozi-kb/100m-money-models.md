## Core Concept

A **Money Model** is the system of offers that determines how you make money. It's not just what you sell — it's how you structure the sale to maximize revenue per customer over their lifetime.

## THE FOUR TYPES OF OFFERS

```
[Attraction Offers] → [Core Offer] → [Upsell Offers]
                                    ↓
                          [Downsell Offers]
                                    ↓
                        [Continuity Offers]
```

Every complete money model uses ALL four types:
1. **Attraction Offers** — Get people in the door (even at a loss)
2. **Upsell Offers** — Sell more to people who already bought
3. **Downsell Offers** — Capture people who said no to upsell
4. **Continuity Offers** — Keep them paying month after month

## SECTION II: ATTRACTION OFFERS

Get customers in the door, even if you break even or lose money upfront.

### Types:
1. **Win Your Money Back** — Buy X, get chance to win cost back
2. **Giveaways** — Free stuff that leads to paid stuff
3. **Decoy Offer** — Offer something obviously worse to make your real offer look great
4. **Buy X Get Y Free** — Bundle free items with purchase
5. **Pay Less Now or Pay More Later** — Discounted entry with full price later
6. **Free Goodwill Offer** — Give genuine value for free, earn trust

> The storage unit guy: "Free first month of storage" but locks cost $47, boxes cost $X, insurance costs $10/mo — turns a FREE offer into $127.

---

## SECTION III: UPSELL OFFERS

Sell more to people who already said YES.

### Types:
1. **Classic Upsell** — "Would you like fries with that?" Right after purchase
2. **Menu Upsell** — Present a menu of add-ons (good/better/best)
3. **Anchor Upsell** — Show expensive option first, then the one you want them to buy
4. **Rollover Upsell** — Move them from one-time to recurring (or low tier to high tier)

---

## SECTION IV: DOWNSELL OFFERS

Capture people who said NO to your main offer or upsell.

### Types:
1. **Payment Plan Downsells** — Can't pay $5,000? How about $500/mo for 12 months?
2. **Trial With Penalty** — Try for $1, auto-bills $X after trial period
3. **Feature Downsells** — Strip features for a lower price point

---

## SECTION V: CONTINUITY OFFERS

Keep them paying recurring revenue every month/year.

### Types:
1. **Continuity Bonus Offers** — Stay subscribed and get monthly bonuses
2. **Continuity Discount Offers** — Longer commitment = bigger discount
3. **Waived Fee Offer** — Waive setup/activation fee if they commit to continuity

## SECTION VI: MAKE YOUR MONEY MODEL

### The Complete Revenue Stack:

```
Customer Journey:

[Attraction Offer: FREE/Low]
      → Gets them in
      ↓
[Core Offer: $X,XXX]
      → Makes you money
      ↓
[Upsell: +$X,XXX]
      → Maximizes revenue
      ↓
[Downsell: $XXX]
      → Captures "no" people
      ↓
[Continuity: $XX/mo]
      → Recurring revenue forever
```

### Key Metrics:
- **LTGP** (Lifetime Gross Profit per customer)
- **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio** — Should be 3:1 minimum
- **Enterprise Value** = Revenue × Multiple (recurring revenue = higher multiple)

### Ten Years In Ten Minutes:
- Build each offer type one at a time
- Start with core offer, add attraction, then upsell, then downsell, then continuity
- Each addition compounds revenue per customer
- The money model IS the business model
