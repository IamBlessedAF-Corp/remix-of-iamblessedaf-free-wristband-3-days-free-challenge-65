# $100M Leads — Knowledge Base

> Acquisition.com Volume II: How to Get Strangers To Want To Buy Your Stuff
> By Alex Hormozi (2023) — 385 pages

## Core Concept

Advertising = the process of making known. If more people know about your stuff → you sell more stuff → you make more money. Having lots of leads makes it hard to be poor.

Hormozi's portfolio: $250M+ annual revenue, 20,000+ leads per day, offers from $1 to $1M+.

## THE ADVERTISING EQUATION

```
Leads × Offer × Sales = Revenue
```

This book assumes you have a Grand Slam Offer ($100M Offers). Now you need LEADS.

## LEAD MAGNETS: Get Leads To Engage

A **Lead Magnet** is a complete solution to a narrow problem offered for free (or cheap) to attract your ideal customer.

### 7 Steps To Creating An Effective Lead Magnet:
1. Identify dream outcome of your avatar
2. Identify a narrow, specific problem you can solve
3. Create a complete solution to that narrow problem
4. Name it using the MAGIC formula
5. Make it easy to consume (< 10 min ideal)
6. Make it high value (they'd pay for it if asked)
7. Make it lead naturally to your core offer

## THE CORE FOUR — 4 Ways To Get Leads

```
                    YOU DO IT          OTHERS DO IT
                 ┌────────────────┬─────────────────┐
    WARM         │ #1 Warm        │ #1 Customer      │
    AUDIENCE     │    Outreach    │    Referrals     │
                 ├────────────────┼─────────────────┤
    COLD         │ #3 Cold        │ #2 Employees     │
    AUDIENCE     │    Outreach    │ #3 Agencies      │
                 │ #4 Paid Ads    │ #4 Affiliates    │
                 └────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### #1 Warm Outreach (1-to-1, Warm Audience)
- Reach out to people who already know you
- Friends, family, past clients, social connections
- The "100 person list" — message 100 people personally
- FREE, immediate, and the best place to start
- Script: "Hey [Name], I'm doing [thing]. It does [result]. Would you know anyone who might be interested?"

### #2 Post Free Content (1-to-Many, Warm Audience)
- Create content that attracts your ideal customer
- Platforms: YouTube, IG, TikTok, LinkedIn, Podcast, Blog
- **Give away the secrets, sell the implementation**
- Hook → Retain → Reward framework
- Your best free content can make the best paid ads

### #3 Cold Outreach (1-to-1, Cold Audience)
- Email, DM, call people who don't know you
- Volume + personalization = results
- Build targeted lists → Send personalized messages → Follow up
- "100 cold outreach per day" rule

### #4 Run Paid Ads (1-to-Many, Cold Audience)
- Pay platforms to show your offer to strangers
- Two parts: Making the Ad + Managing the Money
- **Creative (the ad itself) matters more than targeting**
- Test lots of creatives, kill losers, scale winners
- Key metrics: CPA (Cost Per Acquisition), ROAS (Return on Ad Spend), LTV:CAC

## CORE FOUR ON STEROIDS: More, Better, New

Scale each channel by doing:
1. **More** — Increase volume (more posts, more outreach, more ad spend)
2. **Better** — Improve quality (better hooks, better targeting, better copy)
3. **New** — New platforms, new audiences, new channels

```
More → Volume (do more of what works)
Better → Efficiency (do it better)
New → New Placements → New Platforms → New Core Four
```

## GET LEAD GETTERS (Section IV) — Leverage

Instead of doing it all yourself, get OTHER PEOPLE to generate leads for you:

### #1 Customer Referrals (Word of Mouth)
- The best leads come from happy customers
- Create referral systems (give X, get Y)
- Ask at the moment of peak satisfaction

### #2 Employees
- Hire people to do the Core Four for you
- Cold Outreach → Hire SDRs/BDRs
- Content → Hire content team
- Paid Ads → Hire media buyers

### #3 Agencies
- Outsource lead generation to specialized agencies
- Pay for performance when possible
- Treat as partners, not vendors

### #4 Affiliates and Partners
- Give your lead magnet away through affiliates
- Pay commissions on converted sales
- Create win-win-win (you, affiliate, customer)
