> Acquisition.com Volume I: How To Make Offers So Good People Feel Stupid Saying No
> By Alex Hormozi (2021) — 210 pages

## Core Concept

A **Grand Slam Offer** is a combination of pricing, value, guarantees, and naming that makes your offer so good people feel stupid saying no. Unlike baseball where a grand slam scores max 4 runs, a business Grand Slam Offer can score 1000x payoff.

Hormozi's lifetime advertising ROI: **36:1** ($36 back for every $1 spent = 3600% return)

## THE VALUE EQUATION

```
                Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
Value = ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    Time Delay × Effort and Sacrifice
```

### 4 Variables (in order of importance):

1. **Dream Outcome** (INCREASE) — What they actually want
2. **Perceived Likelihood of Achievement** (INCREASE) — How likely they believe they'll get it
3. **Time Delay** (DECREASE) — How fast they get the result
4. **Effort and Sacrifice** (DECREASE) — How easy/painless the process is

> "The goal is to make the value SO high relative to the price that it becomes an obvious yes."

## PRICING: THE COMMODITY PROBLEM

- If you sell the same thing as everyone else → commodity → price war → race to bottom
- Solution: Create a **category of one** through differentiated offers
- **Never compete on price.** Compete on VALUE.

### Finding The Right Market — A Starving Crowd

Three indicators of a great market:
1. **Massive Pain** — They have a desperate problem
2. **Purchasing Power** — They can afford to pay
3. **Easy to Target** — You can reach them
4. **Growing Market** — The market is expanding

> "A starving crowd beats all other advantages. If you have a starving crowd, you don't need a Grand Slam Offer."

### Charge What It's Worth

- Price is what you pay, Value is what you get
- Higher prices create: Higher perceived value, better clients, better results, more profit to reinvest
- **Premium pricing → premium clients → premium results → premium testimonials → more premium clients**

## CREATING YOUR GRAND SLAM OFFER

### Step 1: Identify Dream Outcome
What does the customer ACTUALLY want? Not what you sell — what they buy.

### Step 2: List All Problems/Obstacles
Every reason they might NOT get the dream outcome. List them ALL.

### Step 3: Create Solutions for Each Problem
Turn each problem into a solution deliverable.

### Step 4: Trim & Stack
- **Trim**: Remove low-value, high-cost items
- **Stack**: Bundle remaining solutions into an irresistible package

### The Four Key Objections (Every prospect has these):
1. Dream Outcome → "This will not be financially worth it"
2. Likelihood of Achievement → "It won't work for me specifically"
3. Time Delay → "It will take too long"
4. Effort and Sacrifice → "It will be too hard/painful"

## ENHANCING THE OFFER

### 1. Scarcity (Limited Supply)
- Physical scarcity (limited seats, spots, copies)
- Time-based scarcity (enrollment windows)
- Create REAL scarcity — never fake it

### 2. Urgency (Limited Time)
- Rolling cohorts
- Seasonal promotions
- Deadline-driven pricing

### 3. Bonuses
- Stack bonuses that solve adjacent problems
- Each bonus should be worth more than the core offer price
- Name and assign dollar value to each bonus

### 4. Guarantees
Types:
- **Unconditional** (money back, no questions)
- **Conditional** (do X and if no result, get Y)
- **Anti-guarantee** (all sales final — for premium offers)
- **Implied guarantee** (performance-based pricing)

> Best guarantee: "Do X, Y, Z exactly as I say. If you don't get [result] in [time], I'll [guarantee]."

### 5. Naming
- **M-A-G-I-C Formula:**
  - **M**ake a magnetic reason why
  - **A**nnounce your avatar
  - **G**ive them a goal
  - **I**ndicate a time interval
  - **C**ontainer word (challenge, blueprint, system, accelerator)

Example: "The 6-Week Gym Launch Blueprint" vs "Marketing Program"
